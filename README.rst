My Project Euler Solutions Repository
=====================================
This repository was created to:

-   Present the resolution used by me in the problems available on `Project Euler <https://projecteuler.net/>`_

-   Organize my code in a code versioning platform so that it is available to everyone who has an interest

-   Interact with the open source community

-   Serve as a personal/professional portfolio of code with the purpose of presenting my logic and programming skills

---------------

**IMPORTANT**

-   **DO NOT CHEAT !** If you are attempting to solve a project euler's problem do not use this repository as an shortcut, develop your own logic, submit it, get it approved and then come to check out my solution

-   IF YOU FIND ANY PROBLEM CODE THAT CAN BE OPTIMIZED IN ANY SENSE, PLEASE SHARE WITH ME AND ALL THE OTHERS :)
